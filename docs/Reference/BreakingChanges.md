# Breaking Changes
This page outlines any breaking changes between breaking game releases
to help with updating mods.

## V25.6
Due to forward compatibility and technical reasons, custom
*Markup* from MGD (not Ren'Py) are now
enclosed with `[]` square brackets instead of `{}` curly braces.

### Fix Instructions
There is a regex you can use in VS Code and Atom to find and replace all
instances of `{markup}` with `[markup]`:

=== "VS Code"

    1.  Go to *File* -> *Add Folder To Workspace...*
    2.  Go back to the `game` folder, click on `Mods`, click on your mod
        folder, click Select Folder/Open.

=== "Pulsar"

    1.  Go to *File* -> *Add Project Folder*
    2.  Go back to the `game` folder, click on `Json`, click on your mod
        folder, click Select Folder/Open.

-   Add your mod to your workspace/project view:
-   Press `ctrl` / `âŒ˜` + `shift` + `f` to open up workspace/project-wide
    search and replace.
-   Add the search and replace values:

Search field:

``` 
\{(ThePlayerName|THEPLAYERNAME|TPN|DamageToPlayer|DamageToEnemy|FinalDamage|PlayerOrgasmLine|MonsterOrgasmLine|DisplayPlayerChoice|DisplayMonsterChoice|ProgressDisplay|AttackerName|AttackerName2|AttackerName3|AttackerName4|AttackerName5|TargetName|AttackerYouOrMonsterName|TargetYouOrMonsterName|FocusedMonsterName|AttackerHeOrShe|TargetHeOrShe|AttackerHisOrHer|TargetHisOrHer|AttackerHimOrHer|TargetHimOrHer|SexAdjective|SexWords|PlayerLevel|PlayerMoney|ColorEnd)\}
```

Replace field:

``` 
[$1]
```

-   Ensure the regex button is turned on in your text editor:


=== "VS Code"

=== "Pulsar"

-   Press 'replace all' in your respective text editor. It will take a
    few minutes to complete.
-   `[SexWords]` in particular is now `[SexWord]` due to a technical
    issue with old saves.
-   In your text editor, do the above regex first, and then make sure
    the regex button is disabled therafter.
-   Search your project for: `[SexWords]`
-   Replace with: `[SexWord]`

### Other v25.6 Breakages

-   Removed `{UseSetColor}` and `{SetTextColor}`.

> -   `{UseSetColor}` is replaced by `[StoredColor]`, working largely
>     the same.
> -   `{SetTextColor}` is replaced by SetStoredColor. You can make use of
>     callscenethenreturn or
>     callscenethenreturn to cleanly set
>     all the colors at any point.
> -   See coloredtextmarkup for more
>     information on the new syntax.

-   `{Pink}` is the one exception to the square bracket change by
    technicality, but now must be closed with `{/Pink}`.

## Upcoming Deprecations

### Planned

-   ChangeImageForFunc, replaced by
    ChangeImageLayer. Threshold has not
    stated a planned version for removal.

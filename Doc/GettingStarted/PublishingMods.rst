**Publishing Mods**
====================

After making a mod, the time-consuming part is over. 
With just a bit more perseverance, this page will help ensure a wider reach for the release of your mod,
to help avoid your mod going undiscovered.

**Packaging Your Mod**
-----------------------

Make sure you've followed the instructions in the :doc:`Meta Creation </Doc/GettingStarted/MetaCreation>` guide, **especially the credit section** if you've used any externally made assets.

If there are any sensitive files you don't want to be packaged with your mod, now is the time to move them somewhere safe outside of your mod folder.

When publishing updates for your mod, providing a changelog via a plain text or markdown file is 
also useful for people wanting to know what's been changed or added since they last played.

The mod will need to be compressed before uploading it to a file host on the web.

Your mod **must** be packaged as a ``.zip`` file, for the following reasons:

* The Mods screen in-game will only extract ``.zip`` files.
* Not everyone will be able or know how to extract something like a ``.rar`` or ``.7z`` file on their platform.

See the instructions on how to make a ``.zip`` file for your given platform:

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Windows

        Right-click the folder of your mod to open, click "Send", and then click "Compressed (Zipped) Folder."

    .. tab:: macOS

        Hover the folder of your mod, control-click, right-click, or tap it using two fingers, then choose Compress from the shortcut menu.
        If that renamed it to Archive.zip, be sure to rename it back to the name of your mod.

    .. tab:: Linux

        This varies per distro. On **Gnome**, right-click the folder of your mod, and select "Compress...". On **KDE**, left-click the folder of your mod, hover "Compress", then select "Compress to...". For other distros, you should see minor variants of the previous instructions, by right-clicking your mod folder, the "Compress/Create Archive" action being either in a "Send/Compress" menu or simply within the base of the context menu.

**File Hosting**
-----------------

Feel free to use other resources beyond the ones mentioned here, but keep in mind not all may be willing to host NSFW games. 
Other file hosts will often have information on their content policies at the bottom of their web pages.

Most importantly, the below are guaranteed to provide download links that work with the in-game mod installer, and a release pages that list the latest versions of your mod.

* `Gitgud <https://gitgud.io>`_ has no restrictions on NSFW content, and has many of their top repositories as examples, though smaller and less proven than the alternative hosts.
* `Gitlab <https://gitlab.com/explore/projects>`_ is a larger platform than Gitgud with the same interface, but has the open risk of less permissive `use policies <https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/policies/website-terms-of-use/>`_.
* `Github <https://github.com/>`_ is the largest platform. While historically fairly permissive of various NSFW projects, keep in mind their `use policies <https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies>`_. **It also requires 2-factor authentication to use.**

**Where To Share**
-------------------

It's highly encouraged to share the link in the following places for optimal exposure for mods to the MGD community. 

Modders can also look for MGD forum threads on the internet to share their mod.

.. _MGDDiscord:

**MGD Discord**
""""""""""""""""

The MGD Discord has historically made for a majority of mod downloads during the first week or two of a mods launch.
The related modding channels on the server can also make for great help, discussion, and feedback for modders. 
If you want instantaneous exposure and player feedback for your creation, there is nowhere better to share your mod. 


Join the `MGD Discord <https://discord.com/invite/monstergirldreams>`_, go the ``#mod-posting`` forum, 
and follow the pinned reference and template post to publish your mod.

Alongside uploading your mod, it's recommended to provide a description and feature list of your mod in the channel, so people know what they're in for. Check the pins in the channel for a template and tips.

.. warning::

    Remember to check the server rules and ``#mod-posting`` forum post guidelines prior to posting.

    Keep in mind the `Discord Community Guidelines <https://discord.com/guidelines>`_ 
    has limits to what content is allowed, and the MGD Discord server is no exception.

    In particular, any content depicting minors in a pornographic, sexually suggestive, or violent manner is not allowed and will be removed. 
    This includes lolicon, shotacon, and cub characters.

    If you're uncertain if your mod is crossing the line, you're free to Direct Message the Moderators on the server.

**MGD Wiki**
"""""""""""""

The Mod List on the `wiki <https://monstergirldreams.miraheze.org/wiki/Category:List_Of_Mods#Making_&_Adding_Mods-0>`_ will make up for a majority of downloads for a mod in the long run. 
Its list is automatically generated from new wiki pages contributed by mod authors, aggregating from the information they provide on their respective pages.

See the "Making & Adding Mods" tab in the How-To Guides section on the page to begin making a mod page. 
It does not require an account and comes with a template and reference for modders to follow upon pressing the "Make Mod Page" button.

.. warning::

    Keep in mind the `Miraheze content policies <https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Content_Policy>`_
    when uploading your mod.

    Like the MGD Discord, any content depicting minors in a pornographic, sexually suggestive, or violent manner is not allowed and will be removed. 
    This includes lolicon, shotacon, and cub characters.

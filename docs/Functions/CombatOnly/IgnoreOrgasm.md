# DenyTargetOrgasm and DenyAttackerOrgasm

`"DenyTargetOrgasm"` makes the target of an attack immune to normal
orgasm calls (e.g. `"PlayerOrgasm"` and `"MonsterOrgasm"` still works)
for a single attack, resetting thereafter. This does mean the target can
still orgasm from recoil.

`"DenyAttackerOrgasm"` specifically exists for letting the attacker
avoid recoil damage triggering an orgasm.

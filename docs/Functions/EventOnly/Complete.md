# Quest, Event, Adventure Complete

## QuestComplete

`"QuestComplete"` makes an event no longer selectable via the Grimoire.
Despite its name, it covers both Quests and Events via the
CardTypeCreation key, so it is capable
of removing both Quests *and* Events in the Grimoire from the player's
view.

!!! tip

    You can still jump or call to the event via other functions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## AdventureComplete

`"AdventureComplete"` makes an adventure no longer selectable via the
map. This affects the adventure for any locations it's listed in.

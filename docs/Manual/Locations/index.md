# Locations Index

Locations are spots on the game map when you select "Go Adventuring!" from the town, defining their icon, adventure, and Grimoire details. Note the town itself is hard-coded, and thus isn't modded like you would other existing locations. Instead, mods can access the town by creating Event JSONs.

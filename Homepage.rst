**Introduction**
=================

**Welcome to the Monster Girl Dreams Modding Documentation for v26.1**.
Here you can find a curated starter guide, optional tutorials, manuals, and various quick reference for all supported MGD modding practices.

The documentation assumes you already have at least a fair bit of experience with the game and understand its various stats from hovering over them in the in-game character menu's 'Stats' tab.

Potential game spoilers abound.

.. note::

  The game is still in active alpha development. Mods you make aren't guaranteed to work with the latest version of the game.
  Your mods are entirely up to you to maintain, unless someone decides to patch your mod for you.
  Warning probably sounds scarier than it actually is.

**Navigating The Docs**
------------------------

All topics and pages in the documentation can be found using the sidebar to the left.
You can use the buttons at the bottom of each page if you wish to go through the documentation linearly.

Use the 'Search docs' text field towards the top of the sidebar to quickly find particular specific topics you're looking for. 
Search currently does not support fuzzy word search, so make sure to spell what you're looking for correctly.

Your browser supports searching for words on any page of documentation as well. You can press ``ctrl + f`` or ``âŒ˜ + f`` to open it at any time.

To begin, start with the first page of the documentation by clicking 'Installing a Text Editor' in the sidebar, or press the 'Next' button at the bottom of this page.

**Getting Help**
-----------------

If you're having trouble with something, there are a couple of options.

* Try looking through the :doc:`/Doc/Reference/FAQ`.
* Ask yourself once more what you need to know in its most specific fundamental steps (e.g. "I need to learn how to add an item I made as a drop to an existing monster, so I should check through the manual section for Monsters."). and try navigating the sidebar down to the most relevant topics.
* If all else fails, you're encouraged to try getting help on the `MGD Discord <https://discord.com/invite/monstergirldreams>`_. There are tons of knowledgeable, depraved, and friendly people there willing to help you, no matter how big or small your problem is. Head to the ``#modding-help`` forum channel towards the bottom of the channel list.

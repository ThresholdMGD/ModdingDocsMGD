This tutorial will show you how to get the X and Y coordinates for positioning location icons and clouds on the MGD world map using Photopea, 
a free photo editor you can use within your browser without any download or sign up. Any other image editor should allow for similar functionality if you already have a prefered choice.

- Go to https://www.photopea.com/
- Open and drag and drop the MGD world map image located at ``/game/images/map/map.png``
- Either drag and drop your iocn, or along the top of the window, press ``File``, then ``Open & Place...``

- Lastly, drag your icon to the desired spot on the map. Zoom in to ensure it is pixel perfect.
- Zooming back out, the left and top coordinates the red lines attached to your icon are the X and Y coordinates you need to put into ``"mapIconXpos":`` and ``"mapIconYpos":`` respectively.

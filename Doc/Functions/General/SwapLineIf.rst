**SwapLineIf**
===============

Lets you swap out individual lines for others based on specific circumstances, or at random. **If no available line is found, it will always grab the last one.**

If a line is blank, the line will be skipped. In case people want to add new lines.

Note you can still use :doc:`Text Markup </Doc/Reference/Markup>` in the possible lines if you want to change the expression, or just generally put functions within them.

Given the function is for smaller scale changes, larger scale scene changes would be better off with an entirely different scene based on a scene jump.

In order to utilize the function, you must use an option alongside it. The below header details each one.

**SwapLineIf Options**
-----------------------

**Random**
"""""""""""

Random has no checks and will pick one of the lines at random to display. You cannot provide it with sub-functions, you would need to use something other than
``"SwapLineIf"`` or use :doc:`Text Markup </Doc/Reference/Markup>` to achieve something to that effect.

You can repeat a :term:`string` to increase the chances that it's the chosen line.

**Time**
=========

.. _PlayerStep:

**PlayerStep**
---------------

``"PlayerStep"`` operates like the passage of time for turns in combat.

This triggers persistent status effects, covering ``"Trance"``, ``"Hypnotized"``, ``"Paralysis"``,  and ``"Aphrodisiac"``, letting their duration and/or potency tick down.

**AdvanceTime**
----------------

Moves forward time. Note there are 6 chunks in a single day.

::

  "AdvanceTime", "1"

``"DelayNotifications"`` can optionally be used thereafter, delaying perk decay notifications until the next time jump, so you don't interrupt a scene.

**RestPlayer**
---------------

``"RestPlayer"`` heals the player as if using a rest point and advances time by 1 chunk.

``"DelayNotifications"`` can optionally be used thereafter, delaying perk decay notifications until the next time jump, so you don't interrupt a scene.

.. _SleepPlayer:

**SleepPlayer**
----------------

``"SleepPlayer"`` advances time until morning and fully heals the player. Also will trigger a dream unless stated otherwise via 'DelayNotifications'.

``"DelayNotifications"`` can optionally be used thereafter, delaying perk decay notifications until the next time jump, so you don't interrupt a scene.

**IfDelayingNotifications**
----------------------------

Lets you check if ``"DelayNotifications"`` was called letting you jump to a different scene if true. **Only works in events.**
This is so ``"TimePassed"`` events can comply with the above functions, but still let them have the opportunity to silently operate.

**TimeBecomesNight & TimeBecomesDay**
--------------------------------------

``"TimeBecomesNight"`` sets the time to false night, while ``"TimeBecomesDay"`` sets it to false day respectively.
The former will clear false days and start false nights, the latter, vice versa.

False nights last until you return to town, use ``"TimeBecomesNormal"`` below, or the next day starts.
False days during the night ends in the next time advancement or when returning to town.

**TimeBecomesNormal**
----------------------

``"TimeBecomesNormal"`` returns a false night or day back to its normal variant. Does nothing if there is no false night or day.

**IfTimeIs**
-------------

Can check for the following: Day, Night, DayFaked, DayTrue, NightFaked, NightTrue, Morning, Noon, Afternoon, Dusk, Evening, Midnight.

**Only works in events.**

**HealingSickness**
--------------------

``"HealingSickness"`` starts a global trigger for tracking if the player healed with a refresh point. Lasts a whole day, or 6 chunks.

**IfHealingSickness**
----------------------

Jumps to the given scene if healing sickness is active. Used to actually avoid the refresh scenes for rest points. **Only works in events.**

**Skill Creation**
===================

Breaks down the :term:`keys` and :term:`strings` used by Skills.

Go to *Json/Skill/*, and then see the .json files present for examples, and **_BlankSkill.json** for a template.

Assume all :term:`keys` are required, unless stated otherwise.
If it requires a non-blank (e.g. ``""``) :term:`value` depends on the given ``"skillType":`` :term:`value` and any noted technicalities.

**name**
---------

.. code-block:: javascript

  "name": "Name of Skill",

Sets the name of the skill, presented to the player in various locations throughout the game and interface, and for internal referral.

.. _costType:

**costType & cost**
--------------------

.. code-block:: javascript

  "costType": "ep",

The type of cost the skill requires in order to be casted. The ``"cost":`` :term:`key` seen below decides the amount based on its given value.

There are three possible types:


* ``"ep"`` consumes the caster's current energy by a given amount.
* ``"hp"`` inflicts arousal on the caster by the given flat amount plus an additional percent based on ``(max health - 100) * 0.15``.
* ``"sp"`` deducts the given amount of spirit from the caster. This is a flat deduction, so it does run the risk of the player defeating themselves by mistake.

.. code-block:: javascript

  "cost": "10",

The given numerical amount of the requirement cost and deduction for the caster, based on the given resource from ``"costType"``.

Negative numbers technically work to allow the cost to benefit the caster, though that means the skill will have no visible downside, unless
intended to be countered in a combat event.

.. _requiredLevel:

**requiredLevel & learningCost**
---------------------------------

.. code-block:: javascript

  "requiredLevel": "1",

Level required for the player to learn the skill from a vendor.
Does not prevent the player from using the skill if they later don't meet its requirements while still possessing the skill.

The :term:`key` does not apply to monsters, and thus can be safely removed for tidiness in such cases.

.. code-block:: javascript

  "learningCost": "100",

Ero cost of the skill from vendors in-game.

The :term:`key` does not apply to monsters, and thus can be safely removed for tidiness in such cases.

**skillType**
--------------

.. code-block:: javascript

  "skillType": "attack",

The type of skill it's, deciding its overall functionality. This influences the behavior of later keys.
The following table presents all possible :term:`values` it can be given.


.. list-table::
  :widths: 1 5

  * - ``"attack"``
    - Increase the target's arousal, and can apply a status effect via the ``"statusEffect":`` key.
  * - ``"Healing"``
    - Recover the target's arousal, and can remove a given status effect via the ``"statusEffect":`` key. *+75 initiative*.
  * - ``"HealingEP"``
    - Recover the target's EP, and can remove a given status effect via the ``"statusEffect":`` key. *+75 initiative*.
  * - ``"HealingSP"``
    - Recover the target's SP, and can remove a given status effect via the ``"statusEffect":`` key. *+75 initiative*.
  * - ``"statusEffect"``
    - The skill is intended to inflict a status effect on the target.
  * - ``"Afflict"``
    - Like the ``statusEffect`` type, but specifically for consumables, ensuring the player can use the item as expected when outside of combat.

.. StatusHeal is a thing but assumed to not be intended for use given how it's laid out internally.

.. _statType:

**statType & requiredStat**
----------------------------

.. code-block:: javascript

  "statType": "Luck",

The type of stat the skill scales off of, used by various keys. See :ref:`Stats`.

.. code-block:: javascript

  "requiredStat": "10",

The required amount of the given ``"statType":`` in order to learn the skill from vendors in-game.
It does not prevent the player from using the skill if they later don't meet its requirements while still possessing the skill.

**skillTags**
--------------

.. code-block:: javascript

  "skillTags": ["Ass", "Breasts"],

What locations on the body that the skill targets,
allowing it to appear in the relevant section of the player's list of skills, assisting monster AI, and how the damage scales.
See :ref:`Sensitivity` for all applicable tags.

Note skills given the tag of ``"Holy"`` will scale with the player's virility.

Additionally, prefixing a tag with ``display`` (e.g. ``"displayAss"``, ``"displayPain"``, etc.)
will display the skill in the corresponding section of the player's list of skills, without making it scale or be recognized internally as a part of the given sensitivity.
**They're required for** ``"Holy"`` **and** ``"Unholy"`` **tagged skills that otherwise feature no other tags.**

**fetishTags**
---------------

.. code-block:: javascript

  "fetishTags": ["Oral", "Handholding"],

What fetishes (and addictions) the skill targets, scaling the damage accordingly, and assisting monster AI.
See *Json/Fetishes/* for all base game fetishes and addictions.


Some tips to take note of:

* ``"Penetration"`` can also be used to cover both ``"Sex"`` and ``"Anal"``, for flexible damage calculations, game logic, and assisting monster AI.
* Monsters can have a ``"Cock"`` fetish for any player and monster skills related to the player's magnum rod.
* Monsters initiating Sex and Anal stances should have the corresponding fetish used in their penetrating skill, while using ``"Penetration"`` for skills that take place in either stance.

.. _targetTypeCreation:

**targetType**
---------------

.. code-block:: javascript

  "targetType": "single",

What participants in the encounter are intended to be struck by the caster's skill.

.. list-table::
  :widths: 1 5


  * - ``"self"``
    - The caster uses the skill on themselves.
  * - ``"single"``
    - Hits the chosen target with the skill once.
  * - ``"2Hits"``
    - Like ``"single"``, but loops 2 times.
  * - ``"3Hits"``
    - Loops 3 times.
  * - ``"4Hits"``
    - Loops 4 times.
  * - ``"5Hits"``
    - Loops 5 times.
  * - ``"all"``
    - Hits all targets present in the encounter. Player only.
  * - ``"Escape"``
    - The caster uses the skill to try and escape all given stances, and if applicable, restraint. Player only.

.. _Stance Control Keys:

**Stance & Control Keys**
--------------------------

Take heed to think through the logic of your stance control :term:`keys` to avoid any potential mishaps or errors that'd prevent them from working as expected.
Ensure capitalization is correct. Also keep in mind that stances are nebulous, see :doc:`Stance Reference </Doc/Reference/StanceRef>`.

You can optionally apply or remove a stance via the following keys.

.. list-table::
  :widths: 1 5

  * - ``"startsStance": ["Sex", "Making Out"],``
    - Applies any of the given stances.
  * - ``"removesStance": ["Penetration"],``
    - Removes the listed stances for both the caster and target. ``"All"`` removes all current stances. ``"Target"`` removes all stances from the target.

Critically, the skill can be made unavailable to the player or monster AI depending on the conditions of the following technically optional keys. 
If you aren't using it and it doesn't mention using ``""``, ``"0"``, or ``"None"``, you should remove it to avoid confusing the AI.

.. list-table::
  :widths: 1 5

  * - ``"requiresStance": ["Sex"],``
    - Requires the **caster** to be in the specified stances. You can also use ``"Any"`` or ``"None"``.
  * - ``"unusableIfStance": ["Anal"],``
    - **Caster** cannot be in any of the specified stances. You can also use ``"Any"`` or ``"None"``.
  * - ``"requiresTargetStance": ["Sex"],``

    - **Target** cannot be in any of the specified stances. You can also use ``"Any"`` or ``"None"``.
  * - ``"unusableIfTargetHasTheseSets": [[ "Blowjob", "Blowjob", "Blowjob", "Blowjob", "Blowjob"]],``
    - **Target** cannot have any of these sets of :term:`arrays` for active stances, meaning all of the listed stances at once. As per the example, if the target is in the blowjob stance 5 times (see imps), the skill cant be used.
  * - ``"requiresStatusEffect": "Charm",``
    - Requires **target** to have this status effect. You can also use ``"None"``/``""``.
  * - ``"requiresStatusPotency": "1",``

    - **Target** cannot have any of the specified status effects.
  * - ``"unusableIfStatusPotency": ["5"],``
    - **Target** cannot have potency equal to or higher for specified status effects in the previous key. You can also use ``"0"`` to simply check if it exists.
  * - ``"requiresStatusEffectSelf": "Trance",``
    - Requires **caster** to have this status effect. You can also use ``"None"``/``""``.
  * - ``"requiresStatusPotencySelf": "3",``
    - Required **caster** status effect must have a minimum of the given potency value. A reminder that it's optional, such as if only checking for Charm.
  * - ``"unusableIfStatusEffectSelf": [""],``

  * - ``"requiresPerk": ["Action Rune!"],``
    - **Target** must have all the specified perks. Can repeat a perk to require multiple stacks of the same perk.
  * - ``"requiresOnePerk": "Swift",``
    - **Target** must have the specified perk.
  * - ``"unusableIfPerk": ["Rut"],``
    - **Target** cannot have any of the specified perks.

.. list-table::
  :widths: 1 5

  * - ``"statusEffectScaling": "25"``
    - For stat buff/debuff skills, deciding their scaling based on the set ``"statType":`` :term:`value` of the caster's stats. 100% of a given stat is equal to ``stat * 1``, 50% ``stat * 0.5``, etc. Can also be used for scaling healing ``"skillType:"`` skills with the skill's given ``"statType":``.

**descrip**
------------

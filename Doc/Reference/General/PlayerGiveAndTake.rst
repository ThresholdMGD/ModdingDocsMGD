**Player Give & Take**
=======================

.. _GiveExpFunc:

**GiveExp**
------------

Despite its name, flatly alters the amount of exp the player has. This means it can both remove and give exp, depending on if you give a negative
or positive value respectively. After altering the exp, it checks to see if the player can level up. The value ignores exp modifiers such as from perks.

.. code-block:: javascript

  "GiveExp", "96",
  "GiveExp", "-43"

----

**GiveItem & GiveItemQuietly**
-------------------------------

Despite its name, ``"GiveItem"`` changes the specified amount of the following item that the player owns. This means it can both remove and give items, depending on if
you give a negative or positive value respectively. You are free to remove as much of the given item as you please, it will not cause any technical issues.

.. code-block:: javascript

  "GiveItem", "1", "Calming Potion"

``"GiveItemQuietly"`` does the same, but does not notify the player.

.. code-block:: javascript

  "GiveItemQuietly", "-1", "Calming Potion"

----

**GiveTreasure**
-------------------------------

Give Treasure requires the player to be in active explore or on an adventure to function properly.
Give treasure takes either "Common", "Uncommon", or "Rare", and rewards the player drops from the respective treasure table rewards for that location/adventure.

.. code-block:: javascript

  "GiveTreasure", "Common"

----

**GiveSkill & RemoveSkillFromPlayer**
--------------------------------------

Using ``"GiveSkill"`` gives player a skill if they donâ€™t have it already.

.. code-block:: javascript

  "GiveSkill", "Arousara"

``"RemoveSkillFromPlayer"`` does the opposite, taking away a skill if they have it. ``"RemoveSkillFromPlayerQuietly"`` can be used to do it without notifying the player.


.. code-block:: javascript

  "RemoveSkillFromPlayer", "Arousara"

An example use case would be to remove skills at the end of combat you gave to the player at the start of combat. Say, a gimmick skill specific to the fight.

**GiveSkillQuietly & RemoveSkillFromPlayerQuietly**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

``"GiveSkillThatWasTemporarilyRemoved"`` & ``"RemoveSkillFromPlayerTemporarily"`` a quiet variant of give skill specifically for temporarily removing skills then giving them back, ensuring they go back into the same spot in skill order to not disorganize player skills. Check Pin for an example. If you want to give the player a temp skill for a fight, like, tail cuddle, you do not need to use this set of functions.

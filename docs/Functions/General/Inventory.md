# Inventory
## AllowInventory
`"AllowInventory"` lets the player access their inventory and use skills
out of combat. Intended for use with Adventures and Events.

Note: Remember to use `"DenyInventory"` to undo this, or else the player
may have access to their inventory in moments you didn't intend for
them to.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DenyInventory
`"DenyInventory"` prevents the player from accessing their inventory.

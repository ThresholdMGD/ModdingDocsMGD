# Adventures Index

Adventures are the menu choices you make on the game map, including the first-time runs you do before you fully unlock a location's menu choices. Examples would be "Shortcut To Nara" or "Visit Amy". These menu choices will proceed to point to an Event if the player meets any requirements.

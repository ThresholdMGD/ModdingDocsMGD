.. _Event Additions:

**Event Additions**
====================

Event additions cover replacing specific scenes, adding new scenes, and appending to the list of ``"Speakers"``.

This does mean your addition would be incompatible with other mods that make an addition to the same scenes in an Event.
This excludes scenes solely using :ref:`MenuAdditions <SceneAdditions>`, for example, when adding to the night life menu in the brothel.

Check **_EventAdditionExample.json** in *Json/Events/* for an example.

The overview will proceed to go over valid :term:`keys` in event additions, how they're added to the base event json, and if their inclusion is required.

.. note::

  ``"CardType":`` ``"CardLimit":``, ``"Description":``, ``"requires"``, and ``"requiresEvent":`` aren't used, and thus should be excluded for tidiness.

**name & Addition**
--------------------

.. code-block:: javascript

  "name": "Lust Rune",

Required so you can tell the game which Event you wish to make an addition to.

.. code-block:: javascript

  "Addition": "Yes",

Required so the game knows you are making an addition.


**Speakers**
-------------

.. code-block:: javascript

  "Speakers": [
    {
    "name": "IDname of Monster you're adding",
    "postName": "",
    "SpeakerType": ""
    }
  ],

While required, it can be left without any :term:`objects` if you don't intend to use it. All added :term:`objects` will be additions, no exceptions.

This means if you want to say, add a ``"postName":`` to a character, you will be limited to appending the character again and using the appropriate
``"Speaks"`` function to use it. This isn't behavior specific to Additions either, this is intended base game behavior as seen for labeling multiple generics.

Note multiple mods adding to the Speakers :term:`key` *could* throw ``"Speaks"`` out of order depending on which mod is loaded first.
Thus, it may be best to rely on :ref:`SpeakFunc` for any new speakers instead to avoid compatibility issues between mods.

**IgnoredChoices**
------------------

.. code-block:: javascript

  "IgnoredChoices": [
    {"11": []},
    {"12": ["SpecificValue1", "SpecificValue2"]}
  ],

Not required, will append additional event choices for the game to ignore,
including new choices and choice values specific to your mod.

**EventText**
--------------

.. code-block:: javascript

  "EventText": [
    {
    "NameOfScene": "Name of a Scene already in the game.",
    "theScene": [
      "The new :term:`strings` provided to theScene."
      "Entirely replacing the original one."
      "JumpToScene", "A New Scene"
      ]
    },
    {
    "NameOfScene": "A New Scene",
    "theScene": [
      "An entirely new scene added to the event."
      ]
    }
  ]

Required, though you technically don't have to provide it with any objects.

Every new :term:`object` will be appended, unless ``"NameOfScene":`` within the :term:`object` matches an existing ``"NameOfScene":`` within the event, in which case
it will override and replace the entirety of ``"theScene":`` with the one provided via the new object.
The exception to this behavior is when using ``"MenuAddition"``.

.. _SceneAdditions:

**Scene Additions**
"""""""""""""""""""""

There are standout instances where you wish to append to options in an existing scene, without causing incompatibility issues with other mods.
The game supports special :doc:`functions </Doc/Functions/index>` for this purpose:

- ``"MenuAddition"`` for appending to scenes (e.g. night life menu via Brothel) with :ref:`MenuFunc`. Meta functions are included.
- ``"ShopAddition"`` for appending to scenes (e.g. Amber's item shop) with a :ref:`ShoppingMenu`.
- ``"SkillShopAddition"`` for appending to scenes (e.g. Elena's skill shop) with a :ref:`SkillShoppingMenu`
- ``"PrependScenes"`` for prepending to scenes. (e.g. NPC scene jump congratulations for beating a new location dungeon)
- ``"AppendScenes"`` for appending to scenes. (e.g. extra fluff dialogue to a scene without a jump at the end.)


You can make use of them through a duplicate scene in the event addition with the same ``"NameOfScene":`` value.
Then, start with one of the three above variants depending on the function you're adding to, only one per scene.
**The first and last :term:`string` of the scene must be the variant, and ``"EndLoop"`` respectively.**

For ``MenuAddition"``, if the menu you are appending to doesn't have a ``"FinalOption"`` in use already, you will have to add it yourself.
it's intended to be applied to 'back out' or 'leave' options, ensuring they are always at the bottom of the game menu.
When addressing this, duplicate the 'leave' choice of the base game, and prepend it with the :term:`strings` ``"OverrideOption", "FinalOption"``.
This ensures it ignores duplicates from other mods also trying to address the issue.

See the examples below for details of the implementation, and the **_SceneAdditionExample.json** file in the  *Json/Events/* for more advanced examples.

.. code-block:: javascript

  "EventText": [
    {
    "NameOfScene": "The Menu's Scene Name",
    "theScene": [
      "MenuAddition",
        "New menu choice",
        "RequiresEnergy", "50",
        "The other new menu choice",
        "OverrideOption", "FinalOption", "Leave",
      "EndLoop"
      ]
    }
  ]

        "A new mod item",
      "EndLoop"
